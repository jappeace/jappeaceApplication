    <h2>Face real world challenges with one on one support from friendly coach Jappie </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Ship <strong>real world</strong> Haskell code while having fun.                                 </li>
      <li>Live feedback in pair programming sessions with a professional.   </li>
      <li>Resume worthy open source contributions, while learning.           </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
Learn haskell through trial by fire, with friendly coach Jappie at your side.
The result of this work being real open source contributions
which can be put on your resume.
This service is similar to how I've taught people Haskell Professionally.
Now available as a service for everyone interested in getting to
that next level fast and pleasantly.
Or for people close to being proficient needing a little extra push.
Gone are the days where people read entire books for learning Haskell.
If you want the best way of learning Haskell, this is it.
I offer you Power Leveling As A Service,
henceforth called PLAAS.
</p>

<p>
Although this works for all skill levels, even complete beginners.
This course is especially useful for those who have
read a lot about haskell, done perhaps a few exercises,
but need a little push to get to that next level.
</p>

<p>
How it works:

<ol>
<li> Fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbtU-7iO4a7CwE-dIyOSe6VnKkmPUlj1g52WezKqiL6es-3w/viewform?usp=header">form</a>.                                            </li>
<li> Free 20 minute intake call.                                          </li>
<li> Payment.                                                             </li>
<li> Enjoy 5 times 1.5 hour pair programming sessions,
   working towards your goals and contributing to your preferred project. </li>
</ol>

The intake conversation is free which is used to modify
the sessions to your personal needs,
for example if you want to master type level programming,
we can hack on servant.
Or if you want to learn Haskell web development,
we can work on keter or flora.
</p>

<p>
Introductory offer: <strong>249 euro</strong> (inc VAT) for 5 sessions of 1.5 hour each.
That's 49.80 euro per session with a coach who's invested in your success!
</p>
<p>
Unsure if this is something for you?
Individual sessions are available for 79 euro per session.
Both applications go through the intake <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbtU-7iO4a7CwE-dIyOSe6VnKkmPUlj1g52WezKqiL6es-3w/viewform?usp=header">form</a>
</p>
<p>
Listed prices are introductory offers and may go up in the future as
I get the "bugs" out of this process.
Please note you can use your company's learning budget to pay for this.
</p>

<p>
<h2>S.H.I.P. ðŸš¢ Early Syllabus </h2>
See Haskell In Production Early Syllabus.
The goal of this methodology is to get patches in production early.
So motivation remains high, despite studens punching above their weight and doing hard things.
Therefore the first and second sessions are about getting
a bug fix merged.
Then after we start working on a minor feature.
Onwards, if the student is interested, we can tackle bigger problems.

Honestly we're doing a psycology hack.

The second part of motivation is obviously having a coach be right there
help you out with the stupid, pointless random shit of software development.
Even if they don't know the anwser right away it's just good
to have someone their share your woes.
