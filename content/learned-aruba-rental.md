[Villa Katalina in aruba~ is online](https://www.airbnb.nl/jappie-aruba).
You can book it now.
This is the rebranded [summerhouse Paradis]({filename}/summerhouse-paradis.md).
I think the project is slowly turning out to be successful,
but it's not like this was easy.
I went into this project knowing full well there'd be trouble,
and boy there was trouble.
In here I'll list the big issues I ran into for future reflection. 
(Aside from the obvious vent)
If you're interested in doing something similar, I think this blogpost
is useful.

The amount of corruption or incompetence is rather staggering.
I say incompetence, because by [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor),
it's usually just that.
For example, 
the notary [johnson and johnson](https://www.johnsonnotary.com/),
took ages to close when I was buying the place.
There was a maximum closing date 
in the contract I assumed it'd be done before that time.
The final closing date was end of july,
I think we closed in October.
Now I was familiar with Aruba culture of taking things slowly,
but I didn't expect things to take this long!
What I've could've done different in this case is contact the notary
more often on progress.
I think they just forgot about this deal or something.
Because closing took so long I essentially mist out of opportunity costs,
I could've opened the airbnb 2 months earlier, in March instead of May.

Another example I'm currently facing is with the power company [Elmar](https://www.elmar.aw/),
and [Mr Green](https://mistergreenaruba.com/) solar services.
The solar panels were installed 15 august, I was promised they
could at least be turned on from that point.
It's now end of December and this still hasn't happened.
And even after that happens the excess is still given away
to elmar for free, after some "mythical" inspection which
has to take at least 6 months.
This little joke is costing me the full power bill which is 250 euro a month.
I've no idea why it takes this long, it's not a big island!
I've learned from my johnson experience so I'm contacting Mr green
weekly.

I also got screwed me over was the amount at 
which currencies can fluctuate,
this caused a lot off stress.
The euro fell rather sharply against the dollar while I was waiting
for the deal to close,
however the listing price was denominated in dollars,
and I had a euro account!
I think in the future I should make sure to get an account
in the denominated currency as soon as I sign.

However, on the other hand,
what I'm really happy with is not going into hyper debt.
My father who financed half this project with a loan recommended me to
look at more expensive properties.
so I was looking at (400k) properties at first, 
However I decided to go with a cheaper option instead (180k),
even though the lender would've agreed to the more expensive option.
I'm really happy I did this because during the project
I decided that a pool would drastically increase the
appeal, allowing me to charge much more rent,
but this would require total another 30k investment.
So then increasing the size of the loan didn't hurt as much in terms of monthly payments.
Furthermore the only thing you got better with the more expensive
option is proximity to the beach.
However I think this is somewhat overvalued,
because public transit is poor in aruba, 
so unless if you're straight at the beach,
tourists are going to have to rent a car anyway.

Just after handover, when starting doing some minor renovations,
I think in general people will recommend you extending the scope of a project
a lot.
This can come from friends and family.
I had discussions about placing more walls for more bedrooms, or placing doors,
or this and that, and most of these changes won't make you a lot of money.
But will extend the timeline, so I refused most of these requests.
However the first guest [recommended](https://www.airbnb.nl/progress/reviews/details/921014041531665037) 
me to put a fence between the pool 
and the patio. So that the kids can be safely led outside.
A minor change in the grand scheme of things, 
which solved a clear problem this guest was annoyed by.
Nobody had recommended me like this, because nobody had stayed
at the place with kids.
Another issue was "non" functioning toilets.
Turns out if you pull up a vlotter in the water resoiver by a tiny
bit they are [functioning. This repair was indeed free and took 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC3xyrOrN-c).
I just kept solving all these problems guests highlighted in reviews,
if they were reasonable, such as
"oh we miss wine glasses", "oh we miss trashcans in the toilets", 
"we don't have actual oven ready pots and pans".
Solving these issues usually cost below 100 euro, and even the fence was done for less then 1000 euro.
Compared to the amount of money I spend for the pool and the house itself this was small change.
However, after having done that after the first couple visits the complaints
stopped and people started giving me consistent 5 star reviews.
Even though the price had gone way up in December.
I learned that the difference between a good stay and a great stay
is many small things, which you probably can't think off ahead of time.
And recommendations from family and friends during renovation needs to be 
carefully considered, because they're not all good!

I learned that people who are good at one job,
may suck if you let them do a slightly different job.
For example the guy who build the
wall (Cesar) and the tiling around the pool
did some great jobs, but then I let him install a shower,
and he sort of flipped around the faucet upside down.
It's still in this awkward position.
It's rather annoying because they'll say they can do it,
even though it maybe their first time doing said job.


Knowing skilled people 
is something which is difficult for most who start on aruba.
I got incredibly lucky with that considering my
parents had already sifted trough so many contractors with their [casa aruba](https://www.casaaruba.info/) 
project.
I was for example able to hire a [local carpenter](https://www.facebook.com/steigerhoutaruba/)
to clear up the entire kitchen for a third of the price I would've had 
to pay if I let euro-kitchen ship it in from europe.
The kitchen looks better as well!
The entire house is now in this scaffolding wood
stile, giving a robust and cozy style.


I'm not sure if it was financially worth it.
My intuition says yes, I ran trough the numbers I need
to make more then 1500 euro a month to turn a profit,
and more then 3000 a month for it to pay back
the rather brutal mortage terms, which will finish in 6 years.
I'm not sure if it was worth it because the first couple months
of this project were naturally the worst ones I could've had,
there were no reviews, so I had to compensate by lowering the price.
Furthermore things like solar panels and my custom 
[rental booking](https://github.com/jappeace/rentals/)
site are still not operational.
the solar panels should bring the electric bill down from roughly
250 to close to 0, and the rental booking website cuts out
airbnb for bookings which take about 15%.

Ironically, despite all the setbacks I may do this again.
Seeing the house come to live, all the reviews from people,
and the appreciation is fantastic.
However I'd like to confirm first if it's financially worth it.
After it has been open for a year, 
I think what I'll do is just make a year overview for this project.
How much it brought in and how much I spend on it.
Furthermore I currently simply do not have the cash to setup another
one.
I feel I'm kinda good at this.
