So [villa katalina in aruba~ is online](https://www.airbnb.nl/jappie-aruba).
You can book it now.
This is the rebranded [summerhouse Paradis]({filename}/summerhouse-paradis.md).

I went into this project knowing full well there'd be trouble,
and boy there was trouble.
These were the most biggest pain points.

The amount of corruption or incompetence is rather staggering.
I say incompetence, because by [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor),
it's usually just that.
For example, 
the notary [johnson and johnson](https://www.johnsonnotary.com/),
took ages to close when I was buying the place.
There was a maximum closing date 
in the contract I assumed it'd be done before that time.
The final closing date was end of july,
I think we closed in October.
Now I was familiar with Aruba culture of taking things slowly,
but I didn't expect things to take this long!
Another example I'm currently facing is with the power company [Elmar](https://www.elmar.aw/),
and [Mr Green](https://mistergreenaruba.com/) solar services.
The solar panels were installed 15 august, I was promised they
could at least be turned on from that point.
It's now end of November and this still hasn't happened.
And even after that happens the excess is still given away
to elmar for free, after some "mythical" inspection which
has to take at least 6 months.
I've no idea why it takes this long, it's not a big island!

Another detail which screwed me over was the amount at 
which currencies can fluctuate,
this caused me stress.
The euro fell rather sharply against the dollar while I was waiting
for the deal to close,
however the listing price was denominated in dollars,
and I had a euro account!
I think in the future I should make sure to get an account
in the denominated currency as soon as I sign.

However, on the other hand,
what I'm really happy with is not going into hyper debt.
I was looking at more expesnive places (think 400k) at first, 
However I decided to go with a cheaper option instead (180k),
even though the lender would've agreed to the more expensive option.
I'm really happy I did this because during the project
I decided that a pool would drastically increase the
appeal, allowing me to charge much more rent,
but this would require total another 30k investment.
So then increasing the size of the loan didn't hurt as much.
Furthermore the only thing you got better with the more expensive
option is proximity to the beach.
However I think this is somewhat overvalued,
because unless if you're straight at the beach,
tourists are going to have to rent a car anyway.

One wild guess I made is that knowing skilled people 
is something which is difficult for most who start on aruba.
I got incredibly lucky with that considering my
parents had already sifted to so many contractors.
I was for example able to hire a [local carpenter](https://www.facebook.com/steigerhoutaruba/)
to clear up the entire kitchen for a third of the
price I would've had to pay if I let euro-kitchen
ship it in from europe.
And it looks better as well!
The entire house is now in this scaffolding wood
stile, giving a robust and cozy style.

I also learned that people who are good at one job,
my suck if you let them do a slightly different job.
For example the guy who put in the tiles and build the
wall (cesar) and the tiling around the pool.
Both great jobs, but then I let him install a shower,
and he sort of flipped around the faucet upside down.



However i already had arranged financing trough a private loan.
On which I was paying interest and principle.
This was also denominated in euro's whereas the purchasing
agreement was in dollars.
This would've been fine if the dollar course stayed favorable,
it didn't.
Probably the fasted colapse in recent history:

Not having a bank account to chug the cash in caused a lot of stress indeed.
All the sudden the house price went up by 10%!
I think as soon as you're under contract,
get into cash as fast as you can into the correct currency.
In this case I could've used my brokerage to get into dollars,
and even though the price was in Aruban florin, this would've been
fine considering it's pegged to the dollar.
However in general just getting a local bank account before doing
any bids is rather adventagous.
Although without an address it's impossible to do this on Aruba.
Even with an address it's still incredibly hard, and expensive.

+ If you have currency convert it as soon as possible to native
  It caused me a lot of stress to see the euro be crushed
  + I think getting a bank account before purchasing the property helps with this.
    This alleviates other issues such as setting up utility payemnts automatically.
+ Do not trust a word real estate agents say,
  I was quoted prices for fixng up the kitchen for 10'000 florin
  Or adding a pool for 20'000. 
  It's safe to double those numbers.
  All in all I spend around 50k in euro's just to patch up the
  property, but in my mind this should've been around 20k.
  Honestly I don't think using a real estate agent gives you
  much asside from help with local laws.
  For example I would've been screwed over early on if I would've
  bought land,
  which had some pretty awfull contractuall obligations attached to it.

+ Expect a lot of things to go wrong.
  I somehow got mildew in the walls.
  This is trivial to solve however, I think it died after
  a single amonia treatment, bleach made it worse however.
  With digging out the pool,
  there was an entire clause within the contract how much extra money it would
  cost if they would encounter hard rock.
  It'd cost like 5000 euro more or something.
  Fortunatly they encountered essentially nothing.
  Even though all wiring was dug in.

+ After you've completed renovations and installed furniture,
  it's only beginning.
  This isn't a project that just ends, you need to plan for continuation.
  I decided to enlist a property manager.
  They're expensive, but I knew these people,
  and I rather pay a bit more and be at ease then shit going wrong.
  This also allows me to leave the island.
  I don't actually want to settle here permenantly.

+ Don't go into hyper debt.
  Most banks won't let you anyway. 
  But if you get a private loan. 
  You want to be able to pay that of based on your own income.
  Actually, I think a good strategy is to postpone paying
  of the principle by a year, and only pay interest the first year.
  The reason for that is that the first year you need to setup
  the place and start cash flowing.
  But things may go wrong, and even after that year you need
  to not go bankrupt.
  Furthermore, being able to pay off loans on your own also
  gives you more comfort in experimienting with the best
  way to yield money from the property.
  Something many people told me in the beginning is that
  long term rental gives comfort, assurance of income.
  But gambling on short term potentially gives higher returns.
  Being conservative with debt, buying a cheaper property,
  allows me to yield /more/.
  And if this fails I still can go into the financially
  more secure route.

+ Always try to negotiate with contractors about prices.
  Eg say something along the lines of,
  yeah I got a quote from one of your competitors, but I really like you guys and want to work with y'all,
  could you perhaps do something about the price.
  Saying just this in one go knocked off 700 euro's for some of the pool stuff.
  That's a lot of money.
  
+ In the purchasing agreement, put a condition on structural inspection,
  as well as a condition on getting finance (even though you have it).
  The condition on getting finance can be a nice out if you encounter hardship.

+ Make sure the guy doing the building inspecting is indeed independent.
  I discovered later that the guy inspecting my building was also a boss
  of my real estate agent, and it turns out my real estate agent
  worked on commission for the purchase,
  in essence, no-one was in my camp.
  It's a miracle this all went decent.




## Cost effectiveness

So going into this I didn't know how good this setup would be.
I'm gaining an understanding of the costs to run this operation however.


| Interest         | 498     |
| Water            | 72.28   |
| Electric         | 250     |
| Pool maintenance | 143     |
| Waste            | 20      |
| Property tax     | 88.4    |
| Internet         | 91      |
| Banking          | 50      |
| Septic tank      | 50      |
| Write downs      | 200     |
|------------------|---------|
| Total            | 1462.38 |


So writedowns is that high because I expect I need
to replace an AC every 5 years, and there are 5 of them.

The debt is denominated in euro.
This currently roughly 122k at 5%.

This is aggressivally payed down however as these are by
far the highest interest loans I have.
By next year the payments will reach 2k per month, in a linear fashion.
So If I wish this property to pay for itself entirely
I need it to make 3k per month.

I took out a separate loan which is included in that of 14k
to install solar panels.
This should mostly cancel out the need for electricity.
I constantly require electricity for the pool and the fridge,
but AC usage is also quite brutal.
Furthermore on airbnb, I get nothing for electric usage.

I expect water costs to rise to around 100.
This measurement was taken when no-one was living in there!
The pool is indeed expensive.
I've hypothesized on how to reduce this cost.
Perhaps putting a simple sheet over the pool will reduce water
evaporation?
It's annoying because if guests are there you don't want to do this,
but once guests leave, you do.
I should discuss this with the maintainer.

Banking is this expensive because I'm a foreigner according to aruba.
This is really annoying, and I should look into becoming a resident.
That'll reduce that 50 euro cost to 5.

In addition to the listed costs above,
the maintainer also charges a fee.
Currently this is 15% of revenue, + $80 for cleaning per visit.
I'm considering however to change this
to 15% of revenue excluding non fincial costs, eg
interest or write downs max(0, 15% of (revenue - non fin costs)).
This way they'll be motivated to figure out ways to reduce costs as well.
Furthermore I've heard from other people that
other property managers are doing this for 10%,
with no fixed costs.
I should talk to these first before renogitiating the contract.
I need to know how much I can shave off.

But I also want to encourage the property manager to find people on their own
So perhaps I should increase their payment to 20% if they reffered it.
Since airbnb charges a 10% service charge.
Airbnb is actually a bad source of income,
the review system can screw you over.

## Getting reputation

So the painfull part is that in the beginning your listing
has no reviews, or reputation.
The only reasonable thing you can do, on platforms
like airbnb, is drop the price.
Go cheap enough and people will come and take a gamble on you.

I had to set the minimum price to around $85 per day,
and $5 per day per additional guest.
If someone would rent for a month they'd get a 30%
discount and a week 10%,
later I changed that to be 25% for a month and 15% for a week.
(to many months were booked which don't give many reviews over time,
and I needed reviews!).

Anyway this ended giving me two bookings of around $2000 each.
so 380 goes to the manger,
1620 left, 1620-1428 for the costs is 192.
That 192 vanished in payments for the principle of the mortage.
For now this is 750 a month, so 550 has to come from elsewhere.
This is why I mentioned before it's better to deffer payment
of the principle with a year or so, so you can get cashflow first,
and then rebuild your balance sheet.

The idea is that this place gets several good reviews,
which would allow us to increase  the price.
Furthermore I want to list on several platforms.


The really painfull part is where you get a 4-star review,
instead of 5, because of minor inconveniences that could've
been easily addressed.
For example the toilets didn't flush well.
This was solved by pulling up the flotter in the water resevoir
so more water accumalted for a flush.
This took literally 2 minutes to fix.
Or having pots that are to thin causig the food to burn.
This cost about $200 to get decent ones.
In comparison to the 250k I just spend, it's not expensive.
But regardless, that review is now eternally 4 stars,
driving my average down for years to come.
