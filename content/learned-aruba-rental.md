This is the rebranded [summerhouse Paradis]({filename}/summerhouse-paradis.md).
It's a villa that can host up to 8 guests located in Aruba.
I think the project is slowly turning out to be successful,
but this wasn't easy.
I went into this project knowing full well there'd be trouble,
and boy there was trouble.
I'll list the issues and lessons learned from doing this for future me.
I may wish to do this again, it was a fun ride.
If you're interested in doing something similar, I think this blogpost
is useful.

The prices for real estate 
were really good in aruba compared to the Netherlands,
I got about double what I could expect in the Netherlands.
Since my parents already have a [investment property](https://www.casaaruba.info/)  in Aruba it seemed 
relatively easy to setup, not to say it's easy.
Another reason for doing this was the low interest rates, 
it looked like attractive leverage.
Furthermore I already had experience with running an airbnb in my own home, 
so I felt somewhat confident I could make this work.
Because my own house is not in a touristic area at all, Aruba is however.
I'd be lying if this was done just for financial reasons.
Ego had a huge part in deciding to do this as well.
For one, not being completely dependent on a single source of income
allows me to take more professional risks and become more productive as a result.
The other reason is bragging rights, not that I wish to brag, 
but the only way to be humble is to have something to brag about [and not do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-huj6EL3A4).
This is so hard.[^ego] ðŸ˜¬

[^ego]: Of course I did tell people about the bnb I bought, of 
        One could even say this post is a giant brag, but hey, I'm not forcing you to read this,
        my dear reader.

I considered many other properties before setting onto this one,
at first I wanted to build a new place.
This made sense to me since labor costs are low in Aruba.
However my father strongly urged against that, citing many experiences
of even the smallest jobs going wrong.
You have to be there and watch contractors like a hawk if you want to do this.
I experienced such issues as well with some contractors while doing the pool house,
for example the fuse switch in the pool house couldn't switch off because
the plastic door was jammed to close to the switches, giving no space to move. 
If you're considering building on Aruba, 
keep in mind you have to be there, or have someone trustworthy there, 
and watch the contractors.

The amount of corruption or incompetence[^incompetence] on Aruba is rather staggering.
For example, 
the notary [johnson and johnson](https://www.johnsonnotary.com/),
took ages to close when I was buying the place.
The closing date was at the end of july,
I assumed it'd be done before that time,
but we closed in October.
I was familiar with Aruba culture of taking things slowly,
but I didn't expect things to take this long!
What I've could've done different in this case is contact the notary
more often on progress.
I think they just forgot about this deal or something.
I was even told this was exceptionally slow.
Because closing took so long I essentially mist out of opportunity costs,
I could've opened the airbnb 2 months earlier, in March instead of May.
Which means I missed all that income.

[^incompetence]: I say incompetence, because by [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor), it's usually just that.

Another example incompetence I'm currently facing is with the power company [Elmar](https://www.elmar.aw/),
and [Mr Green](https://mistergreenaruba.com/) solar services.
The solar panels were installed 15 august, I was promised they
could at least be turned on from that point, 
subtracting power generation from my usage.
It's now January and this still hasn't happened.
And even after that happens the excess is still given away
to Elmar for free, after some "mythical" inspection which
has to take at least 6 months.
This little joke is costing me the full power bill which is 250 euro a month.
I've no idea why it takes this long, it's not a big island!
I've learned from my johnson experience so I'm contacting Mr green
weekly.

I also got screwed me over was the amount at 
which exchange rates can fluctuate,
this caused a lot off stress.
The euro fell rather sharply against the dollar while I was waiting
for the deal to close,
however the listing price was denominated in dollars,
and I had euro currency saved up!
This made the property effectively 10% more expensive.
Considering the price was 180'000 dollar, this cost me 18'000.
I've to admit, I dropped a little tear there.
In the future I should put the closing money 
in a same currency account as soon as I sign.

However, what I'm really happy with is not going into hyper debt.
My father who financed half this investment property[^interest] with a mortage like loan, 
recommended me to look at more expensive properties.
so I was looking at (400k) properties at first, 
However I decided to go with a cheaper option instead (180k),
even though the lender would've agreed to the more expensive option.
I'm really happy I did this because during the renovation
I decided that a pool would drastically increase the
appeal, allowing me to charge much more rent [^more],
but this would require another 30k investment.
This was still possible because the monthly payments weren't as high yet.
The biggest improvement from these more expensive properties 
were proximity to the beach.
However I think this is somewhat overvalued,
because public transit is poor in Aruba, 
so unless if you're straight at the beach,
tourists are going to have to rent a car anyway.
In this regard my more budget stay gives a lot of value to tourists.

[^interest]: He got a 5% interest rate while other mortages were going around for 1.5%. 
             So it's not like I got a handout.
[^more]: Say 50% more.

After handover, when doing some renovations,
many people will recommend you extending the scope of a project a lot.
This can come from friends and family.
I had discussions about placing more walls for more bedrooms, or placing doors,
or this and that, and most of these changes won't make you a lot of money.
However they will extend the timeline, so I refused most of these requests.
However the first guest [recommended](https://www.airbnb.nl/progress/reviews/details/921014041531665037) 
me to put a fence between the pool 
and the patio, so that the kids go safely outside.
A minor change in the grand scheme of things, 
which solved a real problem this guest was miffed by.
None of my family or friends had recommended such a change, 
because nobody had stayed at the place with kids.
I just kept solving all these problems guests highlighted in reviews,
if they were reasonable, such as
"we miss wine glasses", "we miss trashcans in the toilets", 
"we don't have oven ready pots and pans but there is an oven".
Some requests were rather infeasible, such as "move the pool behind the house", and I ignored those.
Solving these issues usually cost below 100 euro, and even the fence was done for less then 1000 euro.
Compared to the amount of money I spend for the pool and the house itself this was small change.
But they were fixed costs.
However, after having done that after the first couple visits the complaints
stopped and people started giving me consistent 5 star reviews.
Even though the price had gone way up in December.
I learned that the difference between a good stay and a great stay
is many small things, which you probably can't think off ahead of time.
Guests will tell their problems however if you ask.
And recommendations from family and friends during renovation needs to be 
carefully considered, because they're not all good!

![the fence is shown behind the pool](/images/2024/fence.jpeg)

I learned that people who are good at one job,
may suck if you let them do a slightly different job.
For example the guy who build the
wall (Cesar) and the tiling around the pool
did some great jobs, but then I let him install a shower,
and he sort of flipped around the faucet upside down.
It's still in this awkward position.
Aruban contracters often will say they can do something,
even though it maybe their first time doing said job.
One has to be carefull about this.
I like this particular contractor however because he can't speak English
and I find the broken hands/feet communitcation rather funny.
So I'd hire him again, but not for showers!

![shower flipped](/images/2024/douche.jpeg)

Knowing skilled people 
is something which is difficult for most who start on Aruba.
I got incredibly lucky with that considering my
parents had already sifted trough so many contractors with their [casa aruba](https://www.casaaruba.info/) 
project.
I was for example able to hire a [local carpenter](https://www.facebook.com/steigerhoutaruba/)
to clear up the entire kitchen for a third of the price I would've had 
to pay if I let euro-kitchen ship it in from europe.
The kitchen looks better as well!
The entire house is now in this scaffolding wood
stile, giving a robust and cozy style.

I was also blessed with the support of my parents.
Aside the financing, they supported me with the paint work,
and there was a lot of paintwork.
Without their help I probably would've spend another 30k on that
and end up with a worse result.

I'm not sure if it was financially worth it.
Intuitively I think it was, but I still need to run the numbers more torughly once the first year is finished. 
My pelimary observation say I need
to make more then 1500 euro a month to turn a profit,
and more then 3000 a month to cover mortgage payments as well.
I've some brutal payback schedule, 
because I didn't like the high interest rate from the private market,
but this will finish in 6 years.
It's difficult to measure if it's "worth it",
because the first couple months of this project were naturally the worst 
ones I could've had, there were no reviews, 
so I had to compensate by lowering the price.
Furthermore things like solar panels and my custom 
[rental booking](https://github.com/jappeace/rentals/)
site are still not operational[^link].
the solar panels should bring the electric bill down from roughly
250 to close to 0, and the rental booking website cuts out
airbnb for bookings which take about 15%.

[^link]: If it is operational this [link](https://rental.jappie.me) should work.

Ironically, despite all the setbacks I may do this again.
Seeing the house come to live, all the reviews from people,
and the appreciation is fantastic.
However I'd like to confirm first if it's financially worth it.
After it has been open for a year, 
I think what I'll do is just make a year overview for this project.
How much it brought in and how much I spend on it.
Furthermore I currently simply do not have the cash to setup another
one.
I feel I'm kinda good at this.
However, If you happen to run a rental and have ideas for improvement? 
Please let me know in the comments!
