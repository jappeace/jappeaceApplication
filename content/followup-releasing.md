This is a follow-up on the [release rodeo]({filename}/releasing-software.md).

After I wrote that blog post, the CTO coincidentally found it quickly.
He was quite okay with everything I had written, he said.
I reminded him that I had also put in the effort of anonymizing everything.
Probably having forgotten the effort I went through to anonymize everything, he really loved that!

The thing he took issue with most was that I referred to his critique of my bluntness as "scolding".
I suppose he didn't go as far as scolding per se.
I described it like that because it fits my personality: I'm a harsh person, I have high standards, and I take criticism extremely seriously.
Even though a person may say "you're kind of doing this badly sometimes," I hear "you suck, Jappie, go do better".[^psyche]
Furthermore, he warned me that if the PM were to ever find it, they might be quite upset.
Which I know, and which is also why I didn't advertise this article.

Anyway a few days later yet another engineer found themselves bitten by the release flag situation.
At this point I knew it was rather important to just inform everyone how this is supposed to work.
So I set out to describe the current situation and make some recommendations.
Actually after having described the recommendations I realized the points of contention weren't
all that many.
The process worked in principle (aside some weirdness around naming),
I think that most people involved hadn't been informed.
Ever since then we've not had any release issues.
So I think the process of writing down the - uh process, solved the issue.


[^psyche]: From this, we can also derive the reason for me being blunt in anger. For a mind that is harsh on itself by default, it takes extra effort to be nice.
