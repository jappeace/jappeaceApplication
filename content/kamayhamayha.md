Summery: I wrote a comic of an idea I had over the weekend.

I just had the weirdest idea for a comic. Normally I don't even like this kind
of humor but this idea just cracked me up:


So I actually made this one last week, but I thought it would not be appropriate to
post on my website.
Then I realized how dumb that thought was, Judge for yourself:

I don't think most people cares about some innocent toilet humor on somebodies
website.

So before putting it on here I tried posting it on Instagram,
but that is surprisingly difficult since it assumes you'll be doing everything
on your phone.
This is the first time since long that I felt really incompetent with a service
(and I use gentoo/linux...).
I guess I'm not really their target audience (to old perhaps).
