I just had the weirdest idea for a comic. Normally I don't even like this kind
of humor but this idea just cracked me up:

![comic here (you shouldn't see this text)](/images/2017/kamayhamayha.png)

So I actually made this one last week, but I thought it would not be appropriate to
post on my website.
Then I realized how dumb that thought was, nobody really cares about some innocent
toilet humor on somebodies website. 

So before putting it on here I tried posting it on Instagram,
but that is surprisingly difficult since it assumes you'll be doing everything
on your phone.
This is the first time since long that I felt really incompetent with a service
(and I use gentoo/linux...).
I guess I'm not really their target audience (to old perhaps).
