You got an offer. Congratulations.
Do you accept it?
How does one know this is the right valuation of your capabilities?
You don't.


In fact you may be tempted to take whatever offer you get.
This is almost surely a bad idea.


The entire ritual of job interviews is designed towards lowering your valuation.
Especially for new workers.


Moreover, it's hard to get them.
You need to show significant interest and jump trough layers of 'hoops'.
So the proper way to treat an offer is as a piece of information towards your
true valuation.



We expect people to become more capable over time in their trade.
Therefore common sense would dictate that you could expect your wage to increase
over time.


# Recruiters
Recruiters get a cut to get you hired. "I get a percentage of how high the offer I can make"

However they oftem will ask you first how much *you* want.

The strategem here seems to be that they will ask how much you want, and then
they will take whatever extra they can get from the company.
