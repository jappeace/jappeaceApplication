After a year in foreign countries, I've returned home.
Last week my working holiday visa expired, and unlike a friend of mine,
I was not in the mood to find out what would happen if I'd overstay my welcome.
(You get deported in handcuffs).

I quite enjoyed my stay in Australia, the people are relax, life is good.
I've drank lots of coffee and ate many a kangeroo, but it's good to be back
and speak my own language.
The people just "[act normal](https://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2010/11/26/no-56-normalcy-doe-normaal/)",
rather than whatever they do in foreign countries.

First I was a month in Indonesia,
essentially looking for jobs in Australia (as you do), 
and hanging out with my then girlfriend.
Then in Sydney I quickly found a job and place to live.
Three interviews were pre-arranged, but, they all got converted in offers.
Around new year our relationship was in crisis, and I went back to Indonesia,
where it failed.

At that point I seriously considered going back,
around February the company also wanted to initiate sponsorship.
However I had become pretty unhappy with the working arrangement.
It looked more like I was just kept being busy,
while having no impact on anything.
That working relationship also ended there.

This was my lowest point in Australia.
I had nothing there except a little hobby project started with some friends.
ex-Colleagues at Openlearning, I was crestfallen and they seemed still pretty happy.
Although being nice about it,
in Netherlands we would rip on each other so hard at this point,
You could at least joke about it you know, but then again, I'm facetious.

Here I decided that rather than giving up so easily I'd fight for staying in
Australia as a software engineer.
I just had arranged better housing, now I bet I could also arrange better work!
Not at first, I emailed so many companies, I even made a little movie to sell myself.

First there was Silicon Valley Chicken, they wanted to sell chicken trough an app with a game.
Completely aimed at Gamers, and only order trough the app.
I wasn't too excited about that, they weren't excited about me being on working holiday visa.
After that I met [Daisee](https://www.daisee.com/) at the functional programming meetup.
I managed to get an interview.
Turned out it was a Haskell job.
I was super excited about that.
Then [Trunk](https://www.jointrunk.com/) wanted to deliver version control to designers.
But I kind off neglected them in favor of the Haskell opportunity. 

This was role reversal, now the friends had a pretty crappy job compared to doing Haskell.
Especially considering the company had taken up [Cosmos db](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/)
which required running windows.
They were both pretty die hard Opensource advocate,
requiring to run this made them not very happy.

I was happy. For a couple of months.
Daisee kept on hiring people however,
and the situation became much more political after they
realized the money making product was doing that months ahead of schedule.
Our CTO's Haskell gamble had payed off.
For some reason he decided to change everything however.
Now we had a traditional hierarchical structure with reporting to mechanisms.
We used to be anarchists you know? 
Oh well it has had little impact on me as the colleague who is "above me",
is not a dick about it (great way of making me leave to would be doing that).
