It has been a month now since I srarted working for [daisee](./starting-at-daisee.md).
Before I started I barely had any real haskell experence,
I still barely have any haskell experience..
But about an order of maginitude more.

Gone are the days I'm confused about how to go from a String to a Text.
You just add `Langauge overlaoded strings` and everything works.
Otherwise go delve into pack and unpack.

I learned about nix and stack, which extensively discussed [elsewhere](./fun-with-stack.md)

I published a package to hackage.

There was a discussion on why haskell in the first place.
Justification never really was a deep consideration of mine.
The code quality is significantly higher with the powerfull type construct
haskell provides, (which is enough for me).
Flat out saying quality is not enough for some other people.

Other justification are that people who know Haskell tend to be better
programmers, someone who has his hands full with Javascript will never
consider going to the lands of Haskell.
It's self selection.

Some people may have had Haskell in uni, and look back on it fondly,
then seeing the possibility of doing it profesionally either
energizes them, or scares the shit out of them.
You probably want the people who get enthouisiastic.
