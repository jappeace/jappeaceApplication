This blog is losing me money[^calc].
It's also a big time investment per post.
Most people don't bother at all,
most developers are happy with just writing code avoiding writing at all.
So why do I bother?

# Clear thoughts
Well first of all, I really enjoy writing out my thoughts clearly once
in a while.
There is no better mirror of how chaotic ones mind is than reading
their own ramblings.

Programming doesn't do this for you.
Imagine shakespeare being writtin as a cooking book:

> Start the thunder and lightening.
> Grab a first witch, a second witch and a third witch.
> Let the first witch say: When shall we tree meet again, in thunder lightening or rain.

The solutions described in programing langauges are meant for machine
consumption mostly,
writing them down in natural langauge is a completly different excersize.
You can be much more lax in natural langauge than in programming.
A misspled word? That's fine, the reader will be a bit frustrated
but do the correction for you.
You can't get away with that in programming.

However, in programming you don't have the problem of keeping your 
audiences' attention.
Are you using a disgusting font on your blog? Fuck you, not gonna read that.
Are you re-using the same vocab over and over? Well fuck you, I'm gonna stop.
You need to be interesting for good writing, which is much
harder than just doing something grammatically correct.

This is what most buisness writers don't get.
Dumping a bunch of jargon in your post is going to shoo away people.
Using politically correct opinions is fucking boring.
You have to take a position to attract an audience.
This is hard.

# Live forever
I also like the idea a little piece of me is recorded in history forever.
I'm well aware that this blog will be taken offline once I stop
paying for it.
For example by being hit by a bus.
But the internet archive is 

Asside that I'm getting a real benefit from this blog by being branded
an expert by google.
I show up whenever one searches for 'reflex haskell'.
That has to be good for something at least in the future.

# Atraxia
Finally some of my most popular posts are born from dealing
with frustrating parts of programming.
The idea that I can take people's frustrations away
by simply documenting my own path trough them is very appealing
to me.
It falls inline with [epicurism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism#Philosophy).
Except in a more altruistic fashion.
In that I'm reducing Aponia, stress, by showing the way.



[^calc]: I'm paying super cheap server hosting costs of about $ 2.00 per month.
		And I have the domain name for about $ 1.22 per month.
		Total add revenue has been up till now about 8 dollars.
		So I've made about $ -108



why blog?

In the pre-history we can read my [motivation](https://jappie.me/website-launch.html#why-make-a-site).
The initial goal was to make money, trough ads or patreon.
T-That didn't work out so well.
In fact I now realize that it's quite hard to make money
with blogging, you've to be really good!
Furthermore from ads you need tons of visitors to get even the smallest
amount of money from ads.
And for patreon to work you need to make something a niche audience,
I think at the time I didn't really know what that would entail.

Another romantic desire
not listed in [that post](https://jappie.me/website-launch.html#why-make-a-site)
was being remembered after my death.
For example consider
"Commentarii de Bello Gallico" (Commentaries on the Gallic War).
People still read that 2000 years after ceasars' death.
I was fascinated by this initially.
Having your words echo trough the ages.
I think I now no longer care so much about this,
because after I'm dead, well, I'm dead.
It'll be y'all problems after that point.


However to achieve this I knew my writing skill had to improve.
I hoped that trough blogging 
my I'd get better. 
I knew my first posts wouldn't be interesting or engaging,
but I could learn from each post.

Then once I got this going, I placed google analytics on it,
and soon realized no-one was reading this blog.
I published something on the internet and no-one was reading this!
I gained some solace from having carved out my own private corner,
so cozy just for me.
So I learned at the beginning of 2017 the internet was already to big.
Still my goal was to be an attention whore,
and to get that you /need/ to post your content on aggregator
websites like reddit or facebook (depending on your audience).
Peeps aren't going to type in `jappie.me` magically in the URL
bar, and Google ain't gonna find you without some links pointing to you.

** Great compromise
Although my desire for being remembered has faded,
I still want to get better at writing.
Because I feel this still covers up flaws I have.
For example, I'm quite bad at self promotion.
I started seeing blogging as a sort of propaganda machine [^gallic-wars],
that would represent me so I didn't have to.
In real life social interactions,
I often come across as if in doubt on my skills,
and I've trouble of thinking what to say in converse.
Furthermore, I don't enjoy convincing other I'm any good at anything,
but as a programmer you pretty have to do this. [^trade-time-for-money]
So rather then changing my personality,
I realized I could get better at writing,
The blog was a great compromise.

** Unexpected consequences
I've noticed that for topics I've written about,
it becomes quite easy to chat about.
This has been a huge benefit for me.
No longer I've to think of what to say,
but I can fully focus on how to say it.
Especially during interviews where the other party
has decided to read what you've written about,
it becomes a breeze!
This truly is an unintended consequence,
but I guess blogging has helped my carreer.


As I blogged I also noticed that the things I wrote about 
become a lot more concrete in my mind.
Obsessing over how to explain something precisely for
a couple of evenings really drives home ideas.
These explenations then can be re-used in later conversation.

Interestingly I noticed another reason to blog lately.
I really enjoy reading back my old articles!
Doing a cute lil' tool survey back in 2017 for example.
At the time I thought I was using some awesome stuff.


[^gallic-wars]: Very much like "Commentarii de Bello Gallico", which more realistically should've been called the genocide of the Gallic people.
