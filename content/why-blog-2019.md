TITLE: Why do I still write this blog?

I've always liked the idea of keeping a journal.
To rember, and perhaps be remembered.
Starting to write and fantasicing about it are two
different things however.
And now I have a proper blog,
which I somehow not completly neglect,
I must be motivated by some good reasons right?
Well yes, but I think it's interesting to
revist my initial reason,
and my reasons for maintaining this blog.
Because maintaining and keeping the habit is hard work.
After all I keep posting articles on here,
something has to keep me going right?
It seems prudent to me to go back to where I started.

We can read my original [motivation](https://jappie.me/website-launch.html#why-make-a-site).
The initial goal was to make money apparently[^forgotten],
through ads or patreon.
T-That didn't work out so well.
I now realize it's quite hard to make money with blogging,
you've to be really good!
I'm not, and that's okay.
From ads you need tons of visitors to get even the smallest
amount of money.
For patreon to work you need to make something for a niche audience,
and captivate them,
I think at the time I didn't really know what that would entail.
For example you've to write things that are interesting to lots of 
people.

But my initial fantasy about a journal was to write primarily for my self.
To remember.
So these desires clash, and it appears writing for myself has won.
Another romantic desire
not listed in [that post](https://jappie.me/website-launch.html#why-make-a-site)
was being remembered after my death.
For example consider
"Commentarii de Bello Gallico" (Commentaries on the Gallic War).
People still read that 2000 years after Ceasars' death.
I was fascinated by this initially.
Having your words echo trough the ages.

[^forgotten]: I long had forgotten this was a serious goal of mine.

To achieve this I knew my writing skill had to improve.
I hoped that trough blogging I'd get better. 
I knew my first posts wouldn't be interesting or engaging,
but I could learn from each post.
So once I got this going, I placed google analytics on it,
and soon realized no-one was reading this blog.
I published something on the internet and no-one was reading this!
I gained some solace from having carved out my own private corner,
so cozy just for me.
I learned at the beginning of 2017 the internet was already too big.
Still my goal was to be an attention whore,
and to get that you /need/ to post your content on aggregator
websites like reddit or facebook (depending on your audience).
Peeps aren't going to type in `jappie.me` magically in the URL
bar, and Google ain't gonna find you without some links pointing to you.

Getting a big name that last trough the ages
was a goal of Jappie from 2017/2018,
I don't think this is no longer a goal of mine.
Once I'm dead, well, I'm dead.
You can remember me all you want, aint gonna bring me back,
and who wants to go back anyway?

## Great compromise
Although my desire for being remembered has faded,
I still want to get better at writing.
Because I feel this still covers up flaws I have.
For example, I'm quite bad at self promotion.
I started seeing blogging as a sort of propaganda machine [^gallic-wars],
that would represent me so I didn't have to.
In real life[^non-internet] social interactions,
I often come across as doubtful on my skills,
and I've trouble of thinking what to say in conversations.
Furthermore, I don't enjoy convincing others I'm any good at anything,
but as a programmer you pretty have to do this. [^trade-time-for-money]
For example during an interview,
or when trying to get another assignment.

So rather then changing my personality,
I realized I could get better at writing,
The blog was a great compromise.

[^non-internet]: Offline interactions

However, this doesn't mean I don't enjoy
writing.
I get a lot of pleasure out of being precise.
Which also feeds my interests in maths,
but merely putting my thoughts onto
paper is apparantly a step up in precision and clarity.
It's quite shockingly enlightening to see how chaotic and rambly
your own thoughts are once you start putting 
them in words on paper or a text editor.
After a mere day of writing a passage
you may question who wrote that.

But I've also noticed that converse on topics
I've written about is quite easy.
This has been a huge benefit for me.
No longer I've to think of what to say,
but I can fully focus on how to say it.
Especially during interviews where the other party
has decided to read what you've written about.
Conversation becomes a breeze!
This truly is an unintended consequence,
but I guess blogging has helped my carreer.

## Frustration
Another use of blogging is letting out professional frustration
in a constructive manner.
For example the [failing in haskell](https://jappie.me/failing-in-haskell.html)
post was directly due to error handling ecnounters in professional code bases.
Explaining this in painful detail.

This also happened with the stack [dependency management](https://jappie.me/fun-with-stack-haskell-dependency-management.html)
post at the time.
Both these posts have seen a lot of user interaction as well,
people started debating about it on reddit or hackernews for example.
So not only does this help me vent, 
it also gets my name out there!
However it's likely not the best idea to become a divisive-andy.
And I don't think an explicit goal of me right now is to
make this blog popular.

I did notic however that once I got a blog post out on something
which frustrates me, the frustration is gone.
It simply no longer bothers me,
because as far as I'm aware that's the most impactful thing
I can do to solve an issue.

## Nostalgia
Interestingly I noticed another reason to blog lately.
I really enjoy reading back my old articles!
Remember that time I immigrated [to australia](https://jappie.me/jappie-lives-with-kangaroos.html)
for a year to do programming there?
Or doing a cute lil' [tool survey](https://jappie.me/tool-survey.html)
back in 2017 for example.
At the time I thought I was using some awesome stuff.

I should more of these slice of live posts.
I've been only doing technical stuff the last couple of years,
and to be honest, I like writing about my own live.

[^gallic-wars]: Very much like "Commentarii de Bello Gallico", which more realistically should've been called the genocide of the Gallic people.


## Interesting Challenge
It's one thing to write a coherent story,
it's another thing to make that story interesting.

Imagine shakespeare being writtin as a cooking book:

> Start the thunder and lightening.
> Grab a first witch, a second witch and a third witch.
> Let the first witch say: When shall we tree meet again, in thunder lightening or rain.

It's boring!
Just like when talking about programming,
we need to make it interesting.
The solutions described in programing langauges are meant for machine
consumption mostly,
writing them down in natural langauge is a completly different excersize.
You can be much more lax in natural langauge than in programming.
A misspelled word?
That's fine, the reader will be a bit frustrated
but it doesn't break the meaning of the story.
You can't get away with that in programming.

However, in programming you don't have the problem of keeping your 
audiences' attention.
Are you using a disgusting font on your blog?
No-one is going to read that.
Are you re-using the same vocab over and over?
I'm gonna stop.
You need to write interestingly, which is much
harder than just doing something grammatically correct.

This is what most buisness writers don't get.
Dumping a bunch of jargon in your post is going to shoo away people.
Using politically correct opinions is boring.
You have to take a position to attract an audience.
This is hard.
