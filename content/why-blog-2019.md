This blog is losing me money[^calc].
It's also a big time investment per post.
Most people don't bother at all,
most developers are happy with just writing code avoiding writing at all.
So why do I bother?

# Clear thoughts
Well first of all, I really enjoy writing out my thoughts clearly once
in a while.
There is no better mirror of how chaotic ones mind is than reading
their own ramblings.

Programming doesn't do this for you.
Imagine shakespeare being writtin as a cooking book:

> Start the thunder and lightening.
> Grab a first witch, a second witch and a third witch.
> Let the first witch say: When shall we tree meet again, in thunder lightening or rain.

The solutions described in programing langauges are meant for machine
consumption mostly,
writing them down in natural langauge is a completly different excersize.
You can be much more lax in natural langauge than in programming.
A misspled word? That's fine, the reader will be a bit frustrated
but do the correction for you.
You can't get away with that in programming.

However, in programming you don't have the problem of keeping your 
audiences' attention.
Are you using a disgusting font on your blog? Fuck you, not gonna read that.
Are you re-using the same vocab over and over? Well fuck you, I'm gonna stop.
You need to be interesting for good writing, which is much
harder than just doing something grammatically correct.

This is what most buisness writers don't get.
Dumping a bunch of jargon in your post is going to shoo away people.
Using politically correct opinions is fucking boring.
You have to take a position to attract an audience.
This is hard.

# Live forever
I also like the idea a little piece of me is recorded in history forever.
I'm well aware that this blog will be taken offline once I stop
paying for it.
For example by being hit by a bus.
But the internet archive is 

Asside that I'm getting a real benefit from this blog by being branded
an expert by google.
I show up whenever one searches for 'reflex haskell'.
That has to be good for something at least in the future.

# Atraxia
Finally some of my most popular posts are born from dealing
with frustrating parts of programming.
The idea that I can take people's frustrations away
by simply documenting my own path trough them is very appealing
to me.
It falls inline with [epicurism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism#Philosophy).
Except in a more altruistic fashion.
In that I'm reducing Aponia, stress, by showing the way.


[^calc]: I'm paying super cheap server hosting costs of about $ 2.00 per month.
		And I have the domain name for about $ 1.22 per month.
		Total add revenue has been up till now about 8 dollars.
		So I've made about $ -108
