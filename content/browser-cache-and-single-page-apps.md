Cache invalidation is hard

Unstable api's are usefull

no caching at all doesn't solve 4xx issues.
Attaching a handler to each request that forces a refresh on 4xx works pretty well.
Except for exiting code out there.
Also if your api becomes stable for some reason client may keep using the same old js for a long time.
