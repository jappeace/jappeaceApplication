So I'm trying to tie in reddit into this website as a comment system.
Basically I want to specify in pelican which subreddits this post should be on.
Then use javascript to find the relevant thread and display the comments of
that thread below this post.

So only stuff would happen on compile time (ie transforming these loosly organized
*.org files into html), where the treads would be created.
And at runtime on the user client (ie in the browser).
I got this idea from the youtube plugin that replaces youtubes horrible 
commenting system with reddit posts if available.
I don't want to even bother with an own comment system.
