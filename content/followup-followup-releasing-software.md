This is a follow-up on the [follow up]({filename}/followup-releasing-software.md) of [release rodeo]({filename}/releasing-software.md).
Okay I should stop doing these,
however I thought the situation was a bit to ironic not to record.
On my final week working for that company [^unrelated-reasons],
the product manager involved found my original blogpost!

Me and a colleague were discussing some performance degradation,
and I brought up the [event sourcing]({filename}/undeadlock-event-source.md) post, because this company also used event sourcing and it was maybe related.
However the PM apparantly followed that link, 
thought it interesting and found the [release rodeo]({filename}/releasing-software.md) post!

He got rather upset,
His issue was that I didn't approach him directly.
I think that's fair, 
although I pointed out that we did solve the underlying problem.
There may not even have been a need
to single out specific roles,
I could've chatted in more general
terms and get the story across.
Because it a post about venting,
although I admit, there was a fair bit of venting.
It was about identifying and solving the underlying issue!
Doing this despite being emotional
Reading it back now I don't think I said anything wrong.
Aside from using chatgpt to make it sound like it's not me ðŸ˜…

[^tax]: I spend contracting to long for them which maybe considered as employment which the dutch tax authority doesn't tolerate. And some technicalities related to option pricing and income tax.


[^unrelated-reasons]: 
   I decided to leave due to unrelated reasons.
   it's a great place to work,
   however I had some tax issues forcing me to quit.
   This was about a month ago.
