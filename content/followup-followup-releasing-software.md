This is a follow-up on the [follow up]({filename}/followup-releasing.md) of [release rodeo]({filename}/releasing-software.md).
Okay, I should stop doing these,
however, I thought the situation was a bit too ironic not to record.
On my final week working for that company [^unrelated-reasons],
the product manager involved found my original blog post!

A colleague and I were discussing some performance degradation,
and I brought up the [event sourcing]({filename}/undeadlock-event-source.md) post, 
because this company also used event sourcing and it was maybe related.
However the PM apparently followed that link, 
thought it interesting, looked around more, and found the [release rodeo]({filename}/releasing-software.md) post!

He got rather upset.
His issue was that I didn't approach him directly.
I think that's fair, 
I feel I would under normal circumstances do this,
however due to history,[^ayden] 
it was difficult for me to take that step.
We did solve the underlying problem however. [^perhaps-antisocial]
There may not even have been a need
to single out specific roles in the original blog post,
I could've chatted in more general
terms and get the story across.
I think in the future I won't do that anymore.
It's just distracting.
Because it wasn't a post about venting,
although I admit, there was a fair bit of venting.
It was about identifying and solving the underlying issue,
despite being frustrated!
Reading it back now I don't think I said anything wrong.
Aside from using chatgpt to make it sound like it's not me ðŸ˜…

Anyway this is the last post in this unexpected "series".
I learned that I should be careful with what I write,
these pages are read by more people than I thought!

[^unrelated-reasons]: 
   I decided to leave due to unrelated reasons.
   It's a good place to work,
   however I had some tax issues forcing me to quit.

[^seriously-why-reading]: I guess the days of nobody reading these are really over...
                          Back in 2017 nobody [read]({filename}why-blog-2023.md) these!

[^ayden]: At some point the company had hired another manager whose only skill was office politics.
          Which caused me a lot of grief.
          This other manager brought the product manager from the original blog post on board 
          and for some reason I had an association in my brain, perhaps unfairly.

[^perhaps-antisocial]: Perhaps in a not too social way, but what do you expect from someone who obsesses over computers for most of their life!
