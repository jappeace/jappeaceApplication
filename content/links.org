A post I'll periodicly update of links I've found that are interesting funny
whatever.

I guess its a +hall+ wall of fame of sorts except it has zero prestige.
(well maybe some day it will)
 
* Beauty

* Funny
** Suicide linux
 I remember a script that would execute =rm -rf /= if you'd type a command incorrectly,
 just to teach you to be precise. 
 It was [[https://qntm.org/suicide][sucide linux]].


* Interesting
** CGPGrey
A youtuber, although I'm linking to his [[http://www.cgpgrey.com/][website]].
He has some interesting videos (of which I know him),
but his podcasts are quite good too.


** Brady haron

Also a youtber, [[http://www.bradyharan.com/][his website]].
