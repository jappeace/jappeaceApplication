On my [twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/jappiejappie) I had project where I made
a [CRT scan line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scan_line) monitor in atom:

The inspiration was the fallout [pip-boy](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pip-Boy).
I though it would be cool to have this be in your editor,
maybe some of the gray beards are nostalgic for this?

What amazes me is that this is possible with just CSS.
Atom has become my favorite editor after doing this project
(although I hardly use it),
and my love for CSS has grown even more!
