Shaders have long been on the list of possible subject to study for Jappie.
The potential of both creating [beautiful art](https://www.vertexshaderart.com/)
as well as doing parallel processing seem incredible valuable capabilities to have.
This post comments on the effort of porting a
[javasript webgl fire](https://github.com/ethanhjennings/webgl-fire-particles)
to an [elm implemention](https://github.com/jappeace/elmgl-fire).
Elm was chosen as target language because it is opinionated, easy and type safe.
In this post we explore how to get started in elm with shaders,
and then move on trying to port the fire project,
finally we try to get as much performance as possible.

# In the beginning there was nothing.

However there are some
[example shader](https://github.com/elm-community/webgl/tree/master/examples)
setups for elm.
The `crate' was [copied over](https://github.com/jappeace/elmgl-fire/commit/fb735158f328789a7c30ae4088b8cffcc4be1fd2)
resulting into having a fully 3d crate!
This is not exactly the output desired, a crate is not a fire (obviously),
but now there is a skeleton for the
[elm architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/)
and some example shaders to play with.

From here on there are two possible paths to continue,
first one can try and completely understand what the shaders do and how they
work,
or one can just copy over the shader code from the Javascript project and see if
we can make that work.
Although
[initial work](https://github.com/jappeace/elmgl-fire/commit/96f3dd293ad72f8b199d7958500f0f14ea2ed013)
was started on the former approach,
the latter approach won out because the topic of 'shader' is just too large.
There is a lot of math involved.
Although this is an exercise of exploration and learning,
trying to understand it all is a massive scope creep.

# Unbreak rendering
After copying over the shader logic from the fire project,
everything broke.
This was not surprising as the crate project was 3d, whereas the fire project
was 2d.
Luckily Elm has strongly typed input for the shaders however (which is amazing).
Therefore solving these mismatches was relatively easy.
We could just follow the compile errors.
When that was [done](https://github.com/jappeace/elmgl-fire/commit/668f714294b4423ae51e8857bf7d9e8dafa4ba8c).
The example program was gutted at this point, only the basic
architecture and api calls were left in tact.
Elm forces this architecture upon us, and there is no choice in this api.
The result of this effort is shown below.

It does not look like much of anything, however, this is counted as progress.
Not having a blank screen is good.
Obviously, the next thing to do was fixing the colors.
This happened by porting the [hue code](https://github.com/jappeace/elmgl-fire/commit/dbe4c308dcc24f0af8ea6b8f85991c1d83354002),
there was no elm implementation for this particular kind of Hue representation.
Because a white background and the hue produces light blue, we added a
[black background](https://github.com/jappeace/elmgl-fire/commit/dbe4c308dcc24f0af8ea6b8f85991c1d83354002#diff-3e16369f543b857a1fea048cf77b7315R120)
which mixes into an orange.
Finally transparency needed to be unbroken.
Transparency was quite interesting because my initial fix involved changing the
shader.
However the the [right (api) option](https://github.com/jappeace/elmgl-fire/commit/dbe4c308dcc24f0af8ea6b8f85991c1d83354002#diff-3e16369f543b857a1fea048cf77b7315R136)
was eventually found
[that solved this issue](https://github.com/jappeace/elmgl-fire/commit/bc9f5d3eecbdc47c0ef0685a005c2af03e1ccd5c).
With all of this in place we get a single circle with the right color!

Baby steps. Graphics take time.

# Random spheres
This is not impressive at all. However, in life one may find that arity changes
everything.
A single dot on it's own is just a single dot, but if we randomly place it all
over the screen we get something nice to look at (live [here](/raw-html/2018/random-spheres.html)):

<video controls loop video controls autoplay>
    <source src="/images/2018/spheres.webm" type="video/webm">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Aside from random creation this doesn't bring us much closer to the goal of fire.
However some more work was done on it because Jappie thought it looked beautiful.
Performance was increased by converting a particle immediatly into it's
webgl representation.

# Movement
To do movement we dropped some changes from the random sphere case.
The idea of not doing an update loop at all is temporary put aside,
because using an update loop is closer to the Javascript original.
Keeping it would be easier to make to just port the Javascript first to elm.

Doing movement is simply adding velocity times time to position every frame.
That's it. The simplex noise part of the javascript code was also implemented
for variation in movement.

It turns out however that the result is somewhat unimpressive.
Yes it looks like fire, but after about 20 seconds the memory is full,
garbage collection kicks in and the program grinds to an halt.
Here is an example (live [here](/raw-html/2018/slow-fire.html),
may grind your computer to a halt):

<video controls loop video controls autoplay>
    <source src="/images/2018/slow-fire.webm" type="video/webm">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## Speed
The problem is that aside from creating particles and sending them to a GPU,
All existing particles must every cycle be updated with the new location.
We may observer however that the path of the particles after creation is
entirely deterministic.
Why don't we let the shaders do this?
The idea being that we create particles with an initial position, timestamp and
velocity.
Then let the shaders calculate the position for whatever the current timestamp
is.

Initially a webgl 'program' was made per quad, because they were named as 'entity'
in the elm webgl api.
This is both slow, innefficient, and doesn't allow us to share the uniform
for more verticies.
So the movement idea breaks down like this because we can't share the uniform
(which contains the updated time) accross all the quads like this
(they already reside in memory).

The architecture was redesiged to take into account multiple particles per elm
entity.
Rather than tracking lists of entities,
lists of tuples of vertices are now being tracked:
`List (Vertex, Vertex, Vertex)`.
It would've been preferable to use `Mesh Vertex` as type, but this type does not
support appending in the elm shader api.

This approach seemed to work much better, in fact this is probably how one
should use this api.
It was possible to render 500 particles now and the computer didn't lock up
(at all):

live [here](/raw-html/2018/fast-fire.html)
<video controls loop video controls autoplay>
    <source src="/images/2018/fast-fire.webm" type="video/webm">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

It's still not very good, as the original was able to do up to 3000 particles
per seconds quite comfortably (with a much better frame rate)...
Currently it is unclear how to improve the speed.
There is not a lot of things done on the CPU side, and still the Javascript
implementation, which does almost everything on CPU, is faster.
Perhaps this is just a limit of using elm.

Unfortunately wind hasn't been implemented, neither have the sparks been.
The port is quite incomplete.
For the wind we require a GSL implementation of simplex noise (perlin noise).
Which should be possible because it's just a big pre-seeded lookup table,
however this is out of the scope of this project.
The sparks are just a particle with different texture and behavior characteristics.
It would be quite trivial to add,
which is left as an exercise for the reader.

## More speed?
After thinking about the problem for some time another idea came to mind.
To increase, the amount of information send to the GL pipeline can be reduced.
Every frame sends this Mesh collection to the GPU trough a buffer,
if this buffer can be decreased in size speed would increase.
It would also lighten the load on garbage collection, as less objects need to
be created.
We can do this rather trivially by representing each particle as a single vertex,
with a position and size.
Then we just use a shader to reconstruct the vertices into quads (squares).
The vertex shader would move the vertex first, then another shader would do
reconstruction, then the fragment shader would do drawing.
Easy as Ï€.

Stackoverflow [suggests](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5821152/opengl-add-vertices-with-vertex-shader)
that we can use a geometry shader for this.
Unfortunately the elm GL api doesn't support this, 
it only has a slot for vertex, and fragment shader in the [entity function](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/webgl/2.0.5/WebGL#entity).
Jappie briefly got excited about adding this shader type to the elm API,
however he discovered that webgl doesn't support this type of [shader at all]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8641119/webgl-geometry-shader-equivalent).

# In conclusion
Upon discovery of the webgl API for elm Jappie was quite excited about using that.
However after using it, and finding the rather large performance difference
the excitement has been tempered.
It's still a good entry point for graphics development,
typesafety makes the complexity quite managable.
A lot was learned from doing this project.
In fact the idea for using geometry shaders would not had been realized at all
in a faster language.

However in future a faster langauge will be used.
Not being able to get everything from a machine is quite frustrating.
This therefore will exclude any use of WebGL.
A major drive for using WebGL in the first place was to share the result online,
however this reasoning is quite flawed in that a video of the result can just
be made.
After all we don't even include the live results here because of concern that it
will freeze the readers' computer.
