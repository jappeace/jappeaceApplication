This page lists a lot of programming projects I made.
here my collected works I ever made.

* Hobby

** Dormant
These projects I want to work on later but I haven't found the time yet.

** Finished
Yes, sometime software actually gets finished.
I finished some projects.

* Proffesionally
These project I made in assignment for other people. 
Usually this means once the features are implemented and not /too/ buggy I
abondon them.
However after considerable time the employer tends to contact me again to
work on it.

* Abandon ware
These projects I will never work on again.

** School projects
By definition school projects tend to become abandoned once completed.
Usually because although you may have enjoyed making it at the time,
once the grade is received you quickly abondon it.

** Hobby
Projects I once enjoyed making but now have abondoned for one or another reason.
