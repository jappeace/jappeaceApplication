This was the first contracting job Jappie accepted.
It started out by some simple requests: ``Please make my website rank higher into 
Google'' and ``Help me straightening out the design in html''.
This was done by modifying the meta tags to rather be as general as possible
for each page to be as specific as https://sensara.heeft-vacatures.nl/java-talent-met-scrum-marathonloop-in-de-benen-rotterdam/183759/0possible.
The html was also cleaned up.

Several months later the request got extended.
"Could I make the static html into a web shop system".
This was done by using two external libraries.
First there was [[http://simplecartjs.org/][simplecartjs]] for offline cart configuration,
and secondly there was [[https://cakephp.org/][CakePHP]].
For handeling payment and storing the items to be displayed.

Being new to programming, Jappie still used PHP a lot.
because he was a second year software engineering student he had also heard
about [[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller-model][MCV]] systems.
Which was all the motivation he needed to give CakePHP a try.
At the time he really enjoyed that framework, it felt much more powerful
than just plain PHP.
MySQL was used as a database, because Jappie was already familiar with that
and he was already experimenting[fn::
There is, or should be an informal rule to programming projects that sais
the reasonable limit for experimentation is 1.
That is to say, only experiment with either one framework, one new database,
or one new langauge. Don't start mixing as it will impact productivity to much.
] by doing CakePHP.
Also at the time it probably didn't even occur to Jappie to try something else.

The reason why the current website is no longer maintained by Jappie is because
of an aversion of using PHP,
and due to poor estimation and negotiation skills,
he kept getting rather low pay for doing this kind of work.
Which was barely above minimum wage at times.
So he decided to focus upon his studies instead.

This company is owned by Jappie's parents.
It's a restaurtant, and as one can imagine, it provides lots of oppuritunity for
automation.

The first task was more of a boast, back in 2008 Jappie barely new some basic
PHP and mysql, yet he told his father he could make the scheduling of
employees much easier by making a webiste for it.
His father must have thought his son would've been crazy,
but rather than dismissing this out of the bet, he decided to challange him.
If you think you can do this, do it, I'll give you money for it he said.
Fast forward a month or two and indeed a system had been created.

The style was ugly, the UX was unfriendly, but it worked. It worked well.
And it saved his father loads of time.
This was actually the pre-pre cursor to the [[http://raster.click/][raster]] project.
The precursor was made several years later when Jappie had learned about
Object Orientated programming and decided to implement his own
MVC framework (don't we all at some point).

This is my parents company.
Over the years I did various automation chores for them.
Which was great because I enjoyed the work a lot but also helped out
my parents business (which usually resulted in them having more time available).
I did various projects for them.
