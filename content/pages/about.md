Good day. I'm Jappie Klooster, at your service.
I like cooking, black smithing
and telling computers what to do (also known as programming).
I'm a freelance software engineer
working for [Supercede](https://supercede.com/) at the moment.

Around 2004 I was high schooler,
perhaps too clever for my own good and a little bored,
so I decided to torment my classmates by writing a mailbomber
in PHP.
Quite a feet for a 15 year old.
Ever since then I've been writing various programs
in all kinds of languages.
These days I've settled on Haskell,
because it's the best as far as I can tell.
And why settle for silver if you can have gold?
I started using Haskell seriously in 2017 when
I joined Daisee as a software engineer.
And have I've been using it pretty much constantly since then.

I like solving problems and produce software that's valuable.
This means I go to great lengths understanding
how a business works and then figure out
where I can contribute best.
It may appear things are done so fast it's like magick when I 
work on a team,
but that's no magick,
I merely understood the business and what people want.
It's surprising how much time can be saved 
with a couple of questions to the right people,
and keeping the implementation as simple as possible.
