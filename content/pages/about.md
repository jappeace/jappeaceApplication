Hello, I'm Jappie Klooster, at your service.
I like cooking, black smithing
and telling computers what to do (also known as programming).
I'm a freelance software engineer
working for [Supercede](https://supercede.com/) at the moment.

Around 2004 I was high schooler,
perhaps too clever for my own good and a little bored,
so I decided to torment my classmates by writing a mailbomber
in PHP.
Quite a feet for a 15 year old.
Since then I've been writing programs
in all kinds of languages.
I started using Haskell seriously in 2017 when
I joined Daisee as a software engineer.
It's the best as far as I can tell.
Which is why I still use it and write about it so much.

I like solving problems and produce software that's valuable.
This means I go to great lengths understanding
how a business works and figure out
where I can contribute best.
It's surprising how much time can be saved 
with a couple of questions,
and keeping the implementation as simple as possible.
