Title: About me
Category: reflection
Date: 2021-09-14

Hello, I'm Jappie Klooster, at your service.
I like cooking, black smithing
and telling computers what to do (also known as programming).
I'm a freelance software engineer
working for [Converge](https://www.converge.io/) at the moment.

Around 2004 I was high schooler,
perhaps too clever for my own good and a little bored,
so I decided to torment my classmates by writing a mailbomber
in PHP.
Quite a feet for a 15 year old.
Since then I've been writing programs
in all kinds of languages.
I started using Haskell seriously in 2017 when
I joined Daisee as a software engineer.
Haskell is the best as far as I can tell.
Which is why I still use it and write about it so much.

I like solving problems and produce software that's valuable.
I prefer simplicity, succinctness and wit.
I get joy out of old things that stood the test of time,
especially (mechanical) machines, books and furniture.
Lastly, I hate the number five.

## About this blog

This is a personal and technical blog.
I post about things that interest me,
and I write here because I enjoy writing.
I enjoy organizing my thoughts,
and I enjoy getting better at writing and reasoning.
My hope is to get better at writing, by doing.
I also enjoy reading back on previous experience.
Nostalgia can be a goal on itself.
I take pride in this work and if you spot grammar issues or
untruths, please let me know.

## AI usage on writing articles

I don't use AI to generate aritcles or paragraphs.
I think I've only generated a paragraph in this [article](https://jappie.me/follow-up-release-rodeo.html).
But I quickly decided against doing so because it felt no longer like my "voice" being used.
I do use AI to check grammar and spell errors, for example with the prompt: "please list all grammar and spell errors, don't skip any as I'm dyslexic: <dump entire blogpost>".
I also ask it for feedback, eg "what do you think about this blogpost: <dump entire blogpost>"
The feedback especially helps me assess if I have sections
that can be misinterpreted in a way I don't want it to be misinterpreted.
I'll never ask it to rewrite it, 
just list the issues,
because I actually don't trust it.

## Why I manually format code
I therapeutically manually add spaces,
to take my mind of the horror I see before me,
that was conjured through me as God's messenger.
I am just a vessel and my abominations are Gods justice upon the world.
I weep for the Mortal souls corrupted by witnessing the horrors I partook in creating.
