Recently I had a discussion on a fellow [streamers channel](https://www.twitch.tv/freeman42x) on why to learn Agda.
A small group of viewers was very eager to learn agda,
but I couldn't get them to articulate why.
Here I could've gone full [socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method)
on them but this can be quite a nuisance.

You see, when I tried learning agda, I hit a wall.
A bit like when learning vim or haskell,
however in those cases I had really good motivations for learning them.
Vim just promised to save time, and it did.
Also it was a need little trick I could show my clasmates.
And after a while it just felt good to use.
Haskell because it had a reputation of being hard to learn
and being an amazing langauge for going fast.
The fact it was hard to learn was good motivation for me at the time
because I was still employing a strategy of just beating up the
biggest 'bully' in the class to show I'm competent.
In a way I was beating up haskell by learning it.
It worked, I felt competent, still do.
So that need kindoff went away for me.

So I re-iterate, Why learn agda?
Were those fellow viewers just not that confident in their haskell
skills so they went looking for an even bigger bully?
Or maybe there is a bigger reason I'm just not aware of.
I feel like I'm gonna end up researching agda so much
because of *other's* people interest in it. 
Then I'll end up learning it because people are talking about it.
But, if that's the case, at least I'll document my efforts here,
so you don't have to learn agda for the same terrible reason I'm learning
agda.
Maybe you'll end up with a good reason.


I found a good motivation of the agda authors in the 
[preface](https://plfa.github.io/Preface/)
of `Programming Langauge Foundations in Agda`.
However it's almost poetic in it's writing.
At least sparking my interest, but it's a bit hard to decode,
so I just write my own interpertation of it in here.

Let's parse it line by line:

> The most profound connection between logic and computation is a pun. 

Just for clarity lets lookup the definiotion of a pun:

> a joke exploiting the different possible meanings of a word or the fact that there are words which sound alike but have different meanings.
