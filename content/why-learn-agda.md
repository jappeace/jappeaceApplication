Recently I had a discussion on a fellow [streamers channel](https://www.twitch.tv/freeman42x) on why to learn Agda.
A small group of viewers was very eager to learn agda,
but I couldn't get them to articulate why.
Here I could've gone full [socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method)
on them but this can be quite a nuisance.
Instead I found the motivation of the agda authors in the 
[preface](https://plfa.github.io/Preface/)
of `Programming Langauge Foundations in Agda`.



Me being the ethernal skeptic started investigating and found a 
motivation of the authors themselves in the 
of 
and a lot is in
that first paragraph.
Let's parse it line by line:

> The most profound connection between logic and computation is a pun. 

Just for clarity lets lookup the definiotion of a pun:

> a joke exploiting the different possible meanings of a word or the fact that there are words which sound alike but have different meanings.
