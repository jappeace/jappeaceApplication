    Times are flexible. The entire course happens online.
    There is an expected homework load of about 45 minutes per day.
    The course is designed to learn Chinese while having a full time job.

    Finishing a 10 week beginner course will definitely improve your skill,
    but you may not be intermediate yet after that.
    The speed of progression is dependent on your own desired pacing.

      <p> I was able to learn read and write 170 new characters
        in perfect pronunciation the first
      10 weeks, while having a full time job.
      Jesiska her Mandarin course is life changing for me!
        I'll definitely be taking another 10 weeks of her fantastic course.

      <p> I wanted to study in china, but didn't know any chinese,
