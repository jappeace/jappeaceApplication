                this is a website I created. Its intended to be a personal website.
                basically I will add my cv, a blog (if I ever feel like writing something).
                and maybe more later.
            </p>

                I decided to make a site because I see a lot of developers around
                me have one to brag about their little hobby projects. Now I have
                made a whole bunch of those but never really took the time to brag
                about it. Soon I will have to look for a job, and then it will
                be more easy to show my capabilities with a supporting site.
                (at least this is what I think)
            </p>

                I borrowed the layout from the linux kernel config.
                Which is beautifully simple. I made the the decision
                to say ignore mobile in my designs, because I think mobile users
                are perfectly capable to read a 800 by 600 website design.
                Also it makes writing css a whole lot simpler, and few people
                actually use their mobile devices as a browser.

                I can always make a supporting app but I don't think my website
                will become popular.

                It is powered by grails.
                I used grails because it allows easy resource management, and I can
                easily add extra features to my site (such as a blog). to my pleasant
                surprise grails moved recently to gradle, which I have some experience
                with. so installing grails was a lot easier than in the passed.
            </p>

            <p>
                As most of my little hobby projects this site is open sourced too.
                I don't intent to cooperate with the development of this site. Mainly
                because its personal. But if you see anything you like you're free
                to use it. (I probably should change the license to BSD).
