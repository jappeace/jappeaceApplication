	<li>Add a button that sends an email to every third customer.</li>
	<li>Add more layers of security (defense in depth)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Build new software</h3>
      It's usually better to keep using as much old code as possible,
      simply because it's tried and tested.
      If needs much I can create something new,
      and I'll use the latest and greatest of programming develpment,
      and I'll make it last forever.

      For example: The programming language I prefer, Haskell, which I'd
      recommend for new projects, has an automated proofing system
      build in ensuring consistency.
      It forces people to write good code, or get nothing working.
      I like this because it blocks people who are subpar from doing 
      anything,
      and they shouldn't.

      Examples:
      <ul>
	<li>Create a new website that hosts a form and posts it to a database.</li>
	<li>Create a simple lottery game for a soccer club.</li>
	<li>Build a mobile app that allows users to share recipes with each other</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Server adminstration</h3>
      Usually I put the systems I work on online myself.
      This has caused me to be familiar with all kinds of system
      administration tasks.
      I'm also well aware of the risks involved.
      I have personal stake in being aware, I run several services myself.
      Including this website.

      I can move your technology stack to wherever you want it to go.
      Depending on the situation I can for make a perfect
      copy of the system that initially is unused,
      test it, and move over the company.

      I can also integrate anything with anything else.
      I'm one of the so called 'grey beards' of system adminastration.
      This includes extensive database knowledge.

      <h2>Core tenets</h2>
      <p>
      In my work I abide to several Core tenets which drive my
      technical decisions.
      </p>
      <h3>Simplicity</h3>
      <blockquote>
      <p>The quality or condition of being plain or uncomplicated in form or design.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
	Therefore reason I follow this tenent is purely pragmatic.
	I want to be able to understand my own code after seeing
	it several months later easily.
	A happy side affect is that other engineers read my 
	code also more easily,
	therefore I become more replacable.
      </p>
      <h3>Robustness</h3>
      <blockquote>
	<p>
	  The ability to withstand or overcome adverse conditions or
	  rigorous testing.
	</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
	The reason I want robustness is more a matter of pride.
	I really don't appreciate code I wrote breaking on the job.
	Therefore I will design with robustness in mind.
	I wish to build things that can stand the test of time and 
	outlive me many times over.
	This restriction also drives me to search for ever more
	powerfull tools.
      </p>

      <h3>Elegance</h3>
      <blockquote>
      <p>the quality of being graceful and stylish in appearance or manner.</p>
      <p>the quality of being pleasingly ingenious and simple; neatness.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
	Ugly systems are hard to work with and demotivating,
	therefore I think elegance is something to be strived for.
	Elegance goes with simplicity nicely.
	This is by far the hardest to do right,
	and usually involves several iterations.
	I believe this includes an elegant user interface,
	although this is even harder.
